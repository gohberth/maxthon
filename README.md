## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option 1: Open Directly (Recommended)
Just double-click `index.html` — it opens in your default browser.

> ⚠️ Some browsers block local file CORS. Use Option 2 if streams don't load.

### Option 2: Run via HTTP Server (Best)
If you have Python installed:
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8080
# Then open: http://localhost:8080
```

Or with Node.js:
```bash
npx serve .
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### ⚡ Quick Frontend (GitHub Pages)
You can host the UI for free on GitHub Pages:
1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Go to **Settings > Pages**.
3. Select **main** branch and `/root` folder.
> [!WARNING]
> The CORS proxy (`/proxy`) requires the Python backend. Some remote playlists may fail on GitHub Pages unless you host the backend separately.

### 🌐 Full Stack (Recommended)
To keep the CORS proxy working, host on **Render**, **Railway**, or **Heroku**:
1. Connect your GitHub repo to the service.
2. Set build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if applicable) or just leave empty.
3. Set start command: `python server.py $PORT`.
4. The app will be live with a public URL!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Stream won't load
- Check stream URL is accessible in your region
- Some streams require VPN
- Try importing via file download instead of URL (CORS)

### MKV not playing
- Use Chrome or Edge (best codec support)
- Some MKV files use codecs not supported natively in browsers

### CORS errors on playlist URL
- The app automatically tries CORS proxies
- If it still fails, download the `.m3u` file and import it directly

### No channels showing
- Make sure the M3U file starts with `#EXTM3U`
- Try the "Paste Text" tab and paste M3U content manually
